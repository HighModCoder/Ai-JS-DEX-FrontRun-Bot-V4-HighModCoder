Whenever you use a decentralized exchange to swap tokens, the price of the token you buy increases slightly. This is called slippage and for most retail traders, slippage is barely even noticeable. Whale traders however, especially when they purchase highly illiquid tokens, can significantly change a token’s price.Frontrunning bots take advantage of this mechanic by beating out the trader on the gas fees, purchasing into a token at the lower price and then instantly selling them off at the higher price. In a block explorer, frontruns leave a clear trace with the trader’s transaction being sandwiched between the two frontrun transactions. #coding #frontrunningbot #javascript #tutorial #botv4 #dex #programming #configuration #learntocode #stepbystep #beginner
